<!-- Making it dynamic 
What do I mean, when I say dynamic - 
1. Changing the elements on the website once the website is loaded 
2. Actually calculating the sum based on the inputs and rendering
it on the screen

that's what DOM facitilates you to do & in loner term: React makes it very easy

Revise -> Classes & id(Unique Identifier)

Classes get rid of code repetition
But what do ids do?
#####################################################
They(Id's) let you access #elements via the DOM API
Can you use Ids to do CSS? Yes
But what do you use it for usually -> JS
