For every Folder using NextJs has 2 things: 
Layout(Big box wrapper) & Page(Content serve)


In Layout 
there is Children
Children are coming from Page.tsx

Frameworks have strict rules( eg: folder,file name ) <-> Library also has but light 

The good thing here in NextJs is we dont need to download external routes packages 

Here inside layout.tsx if you have h2 tag just above children It will be taken out on every single page
