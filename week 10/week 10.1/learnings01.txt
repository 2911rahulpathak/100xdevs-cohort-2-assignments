SQl databases store data in form of rows
example: mySQL,Postgress

what is schemaless(NoSQl->MongoDB):
Different rows can have Different schema (keys/types)

Why SQL?
Define your schema(shape of app)
Put data that follows the schema
Update the schema as your app changes and perform migrations(from now on you have another column)

1)bring up your database (the way we did it in MongoDb)
2) Tell the schema 
3) Put the data
4) If Application grows Updates schema

you want type checking on Database 

Your Postgress connection String:
Postgresql://username:password@host/database 

We can use psql cli -> Its similar to mongoose for MongoDb but It is used in terminal

or pg which is a Node.js library
