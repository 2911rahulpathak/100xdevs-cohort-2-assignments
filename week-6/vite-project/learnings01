Components,State & re-rendering

We need to take care of Components & State 
Other things react will take care of 


State -> JS object that represents the state of the app
The dynamic things in your app(things that change)
eg: Value of the counter

Give the state & all individual components 

npm run build -> HTML,css & JS  -> dist folder



Initial code: 

import { useState } from "react"

//we have component called App
function App() {
  //define state variable
  const [count,setCount] = useState(0); //wont watch the state

  function counting(){
    setCount(count+1)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={counting}>Counter {count}</button>
    </div>
  )
}
