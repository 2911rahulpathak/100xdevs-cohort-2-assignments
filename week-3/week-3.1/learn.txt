Middlewares are mostly used for Prechecks:
There are 2 types of Prechecks: 
1) Authentication ->Make sure that the person is logged in to eg:Linkedin Website -> whats his username
2) Input validation 


Input validation library -> Zod(Tell Zod the structure) -> Typescript first (schema validation)
npm install zod  

You are parsing the input from the end user 

const schema=zod.object(
    {
        email:zod.string(),
        password:zod.string(),
        country:zod.literal("IN").or(z.literal("US"));
    }
)
