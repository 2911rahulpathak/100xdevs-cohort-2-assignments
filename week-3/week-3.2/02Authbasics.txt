Let people sign up to your website
Only allow signed in users to see people (create
a dummy people list)
Authenticated -> only signed in people


Before that:

1. Hashing: why do we hash passwords when you login to a website & hashed password is stored in Databases
converting a string into gibberish(Can never decrypt back)

conver the incoming pass -> hash & compare the hash with Databases

2. Encryption: 2 way (provided you have a key)
eg:Facebook images are encrypted & then encrypted thing is pasted in Databases
WHen you fetch that -> first decrypt & then get back to you

3.JSON Web Token(JWT):

a) some hashing function but It only works for JSON input 
{name:"Rahul"} -> It gives you a very long string
b) token : It takes input & creates a Token(long string)

who ever has this o/p string(token) can actually see the input: jwt.io 
Not protected/Hashed 

Why?? -> People who created it created it 

Chatgpt -> auth-> bearer and long string(JWT)
Copy & paste jwt.io -> see original JSON that was hashed in PAYLOAD(DATA)

## convertion anyone can do but there is verification that only server can do (private/secret key)

{name:"something input"} -> pass this through jwt.encode() & gave a passowrd(only server DB) -> JWT
So given this JWT & password we can pass it and verify it using jwt.verify() function


Backend will always verify


when did you got back JWT token? after singning up -> req in the res it came 

How is it relayed back,where is this token stored? 
Local storage in Application & we send Header 


Also we can do it with cookies  -> This is local storage way of doing Authentication

JWT's saves you a database call when we want to verify the user
