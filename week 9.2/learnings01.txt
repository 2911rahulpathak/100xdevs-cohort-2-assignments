JS -> loosley typed language
c++,java -> strongly typed language 


In jS we can catch runTime errors 
But using Typescript we can catch errors during Compile Time.




For reference: https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/6SbPPXGkG8QKFOTW9BmL/ts-1

const x: number =1;
console.log(x);

//npx tsc --init
// run tsc -b

/* in JS
const x=1;
console.log(x)
const var:type = value;
*/
