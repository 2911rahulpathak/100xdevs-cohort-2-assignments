AWS -> CLoud provider  
eg: AWS has a very big data server in U.S/India and over there we can rent a small server & deploy code 

No worry -> If no visits happen ->0 cost
A server up and running always -> Me paying only wen someone visits the website 

(Base cost even if no one is visiting your website: In case of AWS/GCP/AZURE)

Here Serverless doesn't mean -> No server
It means you as a developer don't need to worry about the server 

Cold start problem:
When no one uses-> No pay 
Suddenly 1000 people visiting & now it needs to quickly bring up the server 


Famous Serverless Providers:
1. AWS Lambda 
2. Google Cloud Functions
3. Cloudfare Workers
