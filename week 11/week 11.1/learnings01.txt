AWS -> CLoud provider  
eg: AWS has a very big data server in U.S/India and over there we can rent a small server & deploy code 

No worry -> If no visits happen ->0 cost
A server up and running always -> Me paying only wen someone visits the website 

(Base cost even if no one is visiting your website: In case of AWS/GCP/AZURE)
