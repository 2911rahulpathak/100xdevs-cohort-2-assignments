ECMAScript ->scripting language specification on which JS is based 

Common JS browser engines: V8(Chrome), SpiderMonkey(Firefox)

Some smart people took-> 
V8 engine Added some backend things(filesystem reads) on top.
To create a new runtime to run JS in backend(compete with BE langaugae)

What can you do with Node.js?
1. Create clis
2. Create a video player
3. Create a game
4. Create an HTTP Server(Main focus)


(History)

What is HTTP(Hyper text transfer protocol) -> 
1. A protocol that is defined for machines to communicate (EG: phone calls)
2. Specifically for websites, it is the most common way for your 
website’s frontend to talk to its backend(2 computers communicate)

What is HTTP Server?

How frontened talks to backend(High overview): lots of wires & routers

Some code that follows the HTTP Protocol 
And is able to communicate with clients (browsers/mobile apps…)
Think of it to be similar to the call app in your phone 
Which lets you communicate with your friend

HTTP protocol:
idealogy:
Client -> server 
Server doing something & responding back -> client 


functions:
1)arguments are something the client sends
2) Rather than calling func using name, the client uses URL

Things that client needs to worry(Client side):
1. Protocol(HTTP/HTTPS)
2. Address (URL/IP/PORT)
3. Route
4. Headers Body Query Parameters
5.Method(Get/Post)


Header-> Authetication Info(Cookie)
Body->what ever you are passing -> to do Backend 
Method -> Get/Post 


#################################
Things that Server needs to worry(Server Side)
1. Response Header 
2. Response Body 
3. Status Code
